The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.
HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.

HttpGet
********************************************************************************************************************************************
- GET requests include all required data in the URL.
- Parameters remain in browser history because they are part of the URL.
- GET requests are re-executed but may not be re-submitted to server if the HTML is stored in the browser cache.
- GET is less secure compared to POST because data sent is part of the URL. So it's saved in browser history and server logs in plaintext.
- GET method is visible to everyone (it will be displayed in the browser's address bar) and has limits on the amount of information to send.
- GET method should not be used when sending passwords or other sensitive information.

HttpPost
********************************************************************************************************************************************
- Parameters are not saved in browser history.
- The browser usually alerts the user that data will need to be re-submitted.
- POST is a little safer than GET because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs.
- POST method variables are not displayed in the URL.
- POST method used when sending passwords or other sensitive information.
